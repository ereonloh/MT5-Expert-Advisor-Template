use any EA you have in your trading account, as long as it does not:

Copy trades of other person's signals
Do tick scalping
Perform latency arbitrage trading
Perform reverse arbitrage trading
Perform hedge arbitrage trading
Perform High-frequency trading
Use emulators
Any accounts using these types of EAs will be canceled, banned, and not refunded.
No grid / no martingale / no recovery / no news logic 

The stop-loss order has to be visible in the trading platform, so you cannot use a ‘stealth mode’ stop-loss.

Must be compliant with 5ers prop trading and pass its bootcamp's Stage 1 requirements: $25k account → 6% profit target with non-strict guidelines below:

EURUSD first (can be adapted to others like XAUUSD if needed)
H1 only
EMA200 trend filter
Pullback entry (price crosses EMA20 back in trend direction)
1 position max
Mandatory SL/TP
Position sizing = 1:X leverage (capped at 1% max risk per trade)
Cooldown after a trade
Max daily loss cap: 2% (equity-based)

Multi-month tuning (opt-in, stays within prop rules):
- Expand session window to capture more trades (e.g., 6–22 server time)
- Reduce cooldown to 60–120 minutes
- Increase max trades per day to 3–5
- Lower min ATR floor slightly (e.g., 5.0 pips) or enable inactivity relax
- Allow larger max drawdown guard for longer runs (e.g., 8–12%)
